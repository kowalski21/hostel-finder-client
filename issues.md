--many have suggested the manager should be given some sort of special ID when signing up and signing in because
any other person at all can do that to create a hostel that do not even exist

--Again for the student page, it seems the student can see some pages they are not supposed to such as the request.
A case where the student is supposed to see only the request ,all the request of other users or student are seen - fixed

--manager shouldn't be given the privilege to book hostel for a student , should always be the student account - fixed

--Now map integration and the payment system.
